# Valid Blockchain

Live `valid-blockchain` branch of the Accessible TPI Chain.

A sovereign **TPI (Three-Party Integrity)** blockchain written from scratch in Rust. No frameworks, pallets, or inherited consensus primitives.

Designed as a reaction to unnecessarily heavy blockchain consensus and PC requirements.

The `main` branch holds the forkable protocol base.

> ✅ **Network Identity Notice - v0.8.0**
>
> Raw IP addresses are no longer stored as peer identity. Peer identity is epoch-salted and hashed from canonicalized addresses. Malformed handshake identities are dropped before hashing. Inbound connections and peer messages are rate limited. All P2P connections are encrypted with TLS 1.3. Certificate fingerprint pinning is configurable. Certificates are ephemeral, generated in memory at startup and never persisted as identity artifacts. Archive segments are published to Arweave mainnet with transaction correctness validated live. A 90-day observer period and passive correlation detection pipeline is in active development. Bootstrap remains a private ceremony between trusted partners. See [NETWORKING.md](https://github.com/HiImRook/accessible-tpi-chain/blob/main/NETWORKING.md) for full details.

## Core Principles

- Single Rust binary: one `cargo build --release` executable
- Entire chain state lives in in-memory HashMaps
- All dependencies vendored
- Merit valued over capital: no token-weighted mechanics, no SPOs, period
- You cannot leak what you never kept

## Consensus: TPI (Three-Party Integrity)

TPI is an original consensus mechanism. It is not a variant of Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, or Delegated PoS. It was designed here as a counter-reaction to unnecessarily heavy blockchain consensus.

- Exactly 3 validators are randomly selected from the eligible pool for each block slot
- Each independently computes a candidate block hash and compares for authenticity
- The highest-merit validator among those in agreement becomes the producer
- The other two act as verifiers. Finality requires 2/3 agreement (sub-second finality on 10-second blocks)
- No capital at stake. No computational race. Merit is gained through participation
- Merit penalizes bad behavior. Mismatches trigger quarantine, which strengthens the validator set over time
- Racer backup system provides automatic failover if any selected validator fails to participate
- Validator legitimacy is proven through block production, not handshake declarations

## Token Economics (VLid)

- Hard cap: 33 million VLid over exactly 21 years (3 epochs of 7 years each)
- Tokens mint only when validated work is proven (when a block is produced)
- No VC allocations, no traditional treasury. Completely non-custodial.
- Epoch 0 block reward: 0.0808 VLid
- Fees: 100% to block producer (temporary, will go to maintenance, legal, and ecosystem grants decided by community governance)
- Genesis bootstrap: 33,000 VLid (0.1%)

Future governance will be merit-based (participation + wallet age).

## Current Status: v0.8.0

**Completed**
- Full TPI consensus (random trio + merit producer + 2/3 finality) - original mechanism
- validator_id removed from peer handshake entirely
- Peer connections are identity-free at the transport layer
- SPO delegation dropped - TPI chain, no longer PoS
- Startup quorum gating replaced by sync-complete readiness
- Raw IP addresses never stored as peer identity
- Epoch-salted peer address hashing - 24-hour rotation window derived from genesis hash
- Peer identity/transport separated - hashed identity layer, raw address transport layer
- Inbound peers registered only after handshake - no ephemeral source port hashing
- Inbound identity derived from canonicalized advertised peer_addr - stable across reconnects
- Address canonicalization module - wildcard, localhost, IPv6, hostname normalization
- Malformed handshake identities dropped before hashing - never hash a non-address string
- bind_canonical_dial_target() - stale provisional dial targets upgraded on every handshake
- normalize_peer_address() overwrites inherited dial target on canonical migration
- Outbound provisional identity reconciled via handshake normalization
- Broadcast dials raw transport targets - logs hashes only
- Gossip stays dialable - known peers distributed as raw addresses
- Gossiped peer addresses validated before entering PeerManager
- RPC addresses validated after canonicalization - invalid normalized RPC not bound
- Invalid their_addr rejects all handshake data including gossip and RPC
- PeerManager::apply_handshake_metadata() - handshake policy in testable helper
- Per-IP inbound connection rate limiting - 5 attempts per 60 seconds, keyed by source IP only
- Per-peer inbound message rate limiting - 100 messages per 10 seconds
- Handshake counts against peer message budget - rate-limited peers disconnected immediately
- Rate check before update_seen() - abusive messages do not mutate peer liveness
- message_timestamps migrated during normalize_peer_address() with stale entry pruning
- TLS 1.3 on all P2P connections - inbound and outbound
- Ephemeral self-signed certificates generated in memory at startup - never persisted
- Peer certificate fingerprints logged for observability
- Shared TLS configs via Arc - generated once at startup, not per connection
- trusted_peer_fingerprints config field - optional SHA-256 fingerprint allowlist
- tls_trust_mode config field - validated at startup, unsupported modes exit immediately
- validate_peer_certificate() - shared cert extraction and trust check for all outbound paths
- is_trusted_fingerprint() - case-insensitive, whitespace-tolerant matching
- Outbound connections and broadcasts enforce fingerprint allowlist
- LoggingOnlyVerifier - naming reflects actual behavior at rustls layer
- Arweave transaction construction validated live on mainnet - signing field order and data_root correctness confirmed
- Arweave wallet loading from file path via ARWEAVE_WALLET_PATH

- Wallet nonce fixed - live nonce fetched from RPC before signing
- GET /nonce/:address RPC endpoint
- /submit returns real success/failure with proper HTTP status codes
- /balance and /block reject malformed requests with 400 instead of silent defaults
- MempoolRejection enum for precise rejection reasons
- Archive/prune no longer holds the ChainState write lock during disk I/O
- Archive file I/O moved off Tokio worker threads via spawn_blocking

## Architecture Highlights

- Pure in-memory state using HashMaps, no database or disk writes during operation
- 6-hour archive segments for durable chain persistence and historical record
- Archive generation runs without holding the chain lock or blocking the async runtime, file I/O isolated via spawn_blocking, duplicate concurrent archive attempts prevented
- Arweave publication sidecar - verified archive segments queued and uploaded to Arweave as permanent off-chain record; transaction construction, deep hash, RSA-PSS signing, and data_root correctness validated live on mainnet; prune never depends on upload success; VIPFS replaces Arweave as the backend when ready
- TLS 1.3 encrypted P2P transport - ephemeral self-signed certificates generated at startup, never persisted, not part of peer identity model
- Configurable TLS fingerprint pinning - trusted_peer_fingerprints allowlist enforced on all outbound connections and broadcasts; empty list means trust all
- Zero Footprint network layer - raw IPs never stored as peer identity; epoch-salted hashed identity separated from raw transport addresses; peer addresses canonicalized before hashing; malformed identities dropped before they become identity material; you cannot leak what you never kept
- Network abuse hardening - inbound connections rate limited per source IP before TLS handshake; message floods disconnected immediately; gossiped peer and RPC addresses validated before ingestion; invalid sender identity rejects all associated handshake data
- Two-tier network model - observer pool open to all connections; validator pool requires 90-day behavioral merit accumulation and correlation analysis clearance before promotion
- Passive correlation detection pipeline - broadcast arrival timing, heartbeat synchronization, reaction correlation, and passive RTT fingerprinting used to identify co-located infrastructure across the observer period
- NodeIntegrityScore - composite promotion verdict separating recoverable current confidence from permanent historical flag record
- Peer-based live sync - one-time startup catch-up via peer RPC endpoints
- Precise RPC error handling - malformed requests and mempool rejections return proper HTTP status codes instead of silent defaults
- Custom P2P and racer system built from scratch
- All constants in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
- Complete file implementations, no partial modules, compact-by-design codebase
- One validator per IP. Sybil resistance without staking minimums
