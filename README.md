# Accessible TPI Chain — Main Branch

A lightweight **TPI (Three-Party Integrity)** blockchain focused on accessibility, decentralization, and merit-based participation. Designed to run efficiently on modest hardware in developing regions while supporting advanced Layer 2 networks.

---

> ✅ **Network Identity Notice — v0.7.6**
>
> Raw IP addresses are no longer stored as peer identity. Peer identity is epoch-salted and hashed from canonicalized addresses. Malformed handshake identities are dropped before hashing. Inbound connections and peer messages are rate limited. All P2P connections are encrypted with TLS 1.3. Certificate fingerprint pinning is now configurable. Certificates are ephemeral, generated in memory at startup and never persisted as identity artifacts. Archive segments are published to Arweave mainnet, transaction correctness validated live. Bootstrap remains a private ceremony between trusted partners. See [NETWORKING.md](NETWORKING.md) for full details.

## What is a TPI Chain?

Valid Blockchain uses **Three-Party Integrity (TPI)** — an original consensus mechanism, not a variant of Proof of Stake, Proof of Work, or Delegated PoS.

**How TPI works:**
- Exactly 3 validators are randomly selected from a pool of participants per block slot
- Each computes a candidate block hash independently
- The highest-merit validator among those in agreement produces the block
- The other two verify — finality requires 2/3 agreement(66.66%)
- Bad behavior loses standing in merit, not tokens as no staking is required
- No capital at stake and no computational race. Merit is gained through participation, wallet age, and must be maintained to avoid decay.

TPI is not borrowed from anywhere. I happily spent the past several years developing this as a counter-reaction to unnecessarily heavy blockchain consensus and finality.

## Core Features

**Consensus:**
- TPI (Three-Party Integrity) — original consensus mechanism
- Merit-based validator selection — no capital required and no SPOs needed
- Racer backup system for network resilience
- 10-second block times with sub-second finality

**Token Economics:**
- 33 million VLid supply emitted over 21 years
- Tokens mint only when work is proven
- Nonce-based replay protection
- Low flat transaction fees

**Infrastructure:**
- 6-hour archive segments for durable chain persistence
- Archive segments published to Arweave as permanent off-chain record — live mainnet validated
- Archive/prune operations decoupled from chain lock and async runtime threads
- TLS 1.3 encrypted P2P transport — ephemeral self-signed certificates, never persisted
- Configurable TLS fingerprint pinning — trusted_peer_fingerprints allowlist in config.toml
- Address canonicalization — wildcard, localhost, IPv6, and hostname normalization
- Malformed handshake identities dropped before hashing
- Per-IP inbound connection rate limiting — abuse stopped before TLS handshake
- Per-peer inbound message rate limiting — flooding peers disconnected immediately
- Gossiped peer addresses and RPC addresses validated before ingestion
- Peer-based live sync catch-up on startup
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Built-in metrics dashboard
- Vendored dependencies for supply-chain security

## Token Economics (VLid)

**Supply Model:**
- **Total Cap:** 33 million VLid
- **Timeline:** 21 years (3 epochs × 7 years)
- **Decimals:** 9 (nanoVLid = 0.000000001 VLid)

**Philosophy:**
- Tokens mint ONLY when work is proven
- No pre-mine, no VC allocations
- No treasury, no foundation
- Merit-based governance (not token-weighted, anti-whale)

## Architecture Highlights

**TPI Consensus:**
Three-Party Integrity is an original consensus mechanism. Three validators are selected per slot from a pool of participants, each independently computes a candidate block hash, compares for authenticity, and the highest-merit validator among those in agreement produces. No capital at stake. No computational race. Validator legitimacy is proven through block production, not handshake declarations.

**Zero Footprint Network Layer:**
Raw IP addresses never exist as peer identity artifacts. Peer identity is epoch-salted and hashed from canonicalized addresses at the point of first contact. Malformed handshake identities are dropped before hashing — a non-address string never becomes identity material. Transport addresses live only in a separate mechanical-necessity layer. You cannot leak what you never kept.

**Address Canonicalization:**
All inbound peer addresses are canonicalized before hashing — wildcard bind addresses replaced with actual transport IP, localhost normalized, IPv6 correctly bracketed, hostnames lowercased. Stale provisional dial targets are upgraded on every handshake via explicit canonical upgrade. The identity and transport layers are cleanly separated at every path.

**Network Abuse Hardening:**
Inbound connections are rate limited per source IP before the TLS handshake — ephemeral port rotation does not bypass the limit. Post-handshake message floods are disconnected immediately. Gossiped peer addresses and advertised RPC endpoints are validated before ingestion. Invalid peer identity in a handshake causes all associated handshake data to be ignored.

**TLS 1.3 P2P Transport:**
All peer connections are encrypted with TLS 1.3. Certificates are ephemeral — generated in memory at startup and discarded on shutdown. Certificate fingerprint pinning is now configurable via trusted_peer_fingerprints in config.toml. All outbound connections and broadcasts enforce the allowlist. Empty allowlist means trust all — existing deployments require no changes.

**Arweave Publication Sidecar:**
After each verified local archive segment, a publication manifest is queued. A background task processes the queue every 5 minutes, uploading segments to Arweave as permanent off-chain storage. Transaction construction, deep hash, RSA-PSS signing, and data_root correctness are validated against Arweave mainnet. Prune correctness never depends on upload success as local durability always gates prune. When VIPFS is ready, it replaces Arweave as the publication backend without touching validator logic.

**Zero-Comment Code:**
Self-documenting variable names eliminate need for comments. Complexity that requires explanation is unnecessary and just an extra layer of work.

**In-Memory State:**
Complete state management using HashMaps. No external database dependencies ensures sovereignty and auditability.

**6-Hour Archive Segments:**
Every 2,160 blocks, the retiring block range is written as a durable archive segment. This is the chain's long-term memory, not a restore checkpoint, but a permanent historical record. Peers handle live catch-up sync. This method replaces the planned "memory pruning" update.

**Lock-Scoped Archive Generation:**
Archive segment building, writing, and verification run without holding the chain state lock and without blocking the async runtime. File I/O is isolated via spawn_blocking, and the chain lock is only briefly acquired to clone the block range and, after success, to prune it. Duplicate concurrent archive attempts for the same segment are prevented by an in-memory guard.

**Peer-Based Live Sync:**
On startup, the node queries peers for their current head and fetches any missing blocks sequentially. Production only begins after successful catch-up. Partial sync failure exits cleanly rather than allowing stale-state production.

**Precise RPC Error Handling:**
Malformed requests and mempool rejections return proper HTTP status codes with clear reasons rather than silently defaulting or always reporting success. /submit distinguishes accepted, duplicate, and full-mempool outcomes.

**Vendored Dependencies:**
All dependencies vendored for supply-chain security.

**One Validator Per IP:**
Anti-Sybil protection at network level. Decentralization through geographic distribution.
